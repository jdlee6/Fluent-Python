TUPLES PROPERTIES THAT ARE SHARED WITH LISTS

s.__add__(s2) --> s + s2 [concatenation]
s.__contain__(e) --> e in s 
s.count(e) --> count occurences of an element
s.__getitem__(p) --> s[p] - get item at position
s.__getnewargs__() --> support for optimized serialization with pickle [only for tuples not lists]
s.index(e) --> find position of first occurence of element
s.__iter__() --> get iterator
s.__len__() --> len(s) - number of items
s.__mul__(n) --> s * n - repeated concatenation
s.__rmul__(n) --> n * s - reverse repeated concatenation (Reversed operators are explained in Chapter 13)
